    <h1>Our Story</h1>
    <p>
      Durra was born from a vision to bring elegance, trust, and local craftsmanship into one seamless experience.
      We understand the frustrations of navigating countless jewelry stores, comparing prices and authenticity,
      and the inconvenience of post-sale errands. That’s why we created a platform that centers on your needs as a buyer.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Commitment</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Local Support:</strong> We highlight Bahraini gold and pearl artisans, helping you discover
        authentic pieces while supporting your community.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Transparent Shopping:</strong> Navigate with confidence—search and compare in one place,
        with clear details and trust backed by institutions like DANAT and GIA.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Convenience & Care:</strong> Secure, Shariah-compliant payments, safe delivery, and hassle-free post-sale
        services—no chasing after stores for alterations or returns.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Thank you for joining us on this journey. Durra isn't just another jewelry platform—it’s
      a community where stories are shared, trust is built, and decisions are made with heart.
